Today I decided to explore generative art, and ended up with generating a perlin noise flowfield. All the particles follow vectors, whose direction is determined using Perlin Noise
to make the particles flow in a wind-like manner. I also added color to each particle's path based off a golden ratio related algorithm to further make everything visually satisfying.
